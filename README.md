This game is something I made for my Grade 10 Computer Science ISU. It is inspired by a ROBLOX game
called Risky Strats which you can find footage of over here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQspQ3mboo0 

To run this program, ensure you have a working installation of Python and have installed the pygame
module (pip install pygame). Then, run main.py and the game should work. From there, use the up and
down arrow keys to navigate the main menu and use the enter key to select options. The rest is
self explanatory.
